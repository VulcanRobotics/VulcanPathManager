# VulcanPathManager
The Vulcan Path Manager is designed to make path generation using team 254's TrajectoryLib easier and faster. The getPath function is compatable with TrajectoryLib's generatePath function. It would try to look for a stored path on disk. If it couldn't find it or the parameters of the file found does not match the path requested, it would generate the path and write the result to file so next time it would be faster.
